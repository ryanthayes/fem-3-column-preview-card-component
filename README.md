## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I am still not as confident with grid compared to flex. I tried to create this whole project as one big grid with two rows. But I struggled for over an hour trying to get the "cards" to move to different grid columns on the second row. 

I tried grid areas. I tried grid-column-rows. All three "cards" just stayed in the first column of the second row. I could move the two divs on the top row, but no success on the bottom row. So, I ended up using a separate grid for the bottom row.
